Peeter's Schwarzschild EOMs.
---------------------------
I'll do the last bit first -

1. You're working in 2 spatial dimensions with \phi held constant ( good, it gets more messy with the whole lot).
2. It looks correct, I can't find a false step. 
3. 'm' should be cancelled from the final equation, because it's kinematic.
The Schwarzschild metric is the exterior space-time around a spherically symmetric source with mass M.
The equations of motion are really the paths of massless test particles, so there's no 'm' except the source in the equations.
There are an infinite number of radial geodesics parameterised by different proper times, depending on initial conditions. So which initial conditions apply to your solution ? I think there is a hidden assumption that initial velocity vector is ( 1, 0 ) or (c, 0 ) or (-c, 0) which is only true for a particle at infinity with no velocity relative to the source. It happens when you use the metric to eliminate \dot{r} from the r EOM. When the metric is divided by c^2d\tau^2, the result *is* the length of the velocity vector squared. Set to 1 by this move.

That fits in with everything else I've seen. It's a very handy calculation, and you could probably go on to find the precession of orbits in the plane. I think the extra term in A is the one you won't get in Newtonian mechanics.

To adapt your equations to different initial conditions, [the most general being ( (1-2m/R)^-1/2, v_0 ) at the event (0, R)] one needs to take into account that the initial value of the (velocity)^2 is now -g_00(1-2m/R)^-1 + g_11c^-2v_0^2.

I'm working on that in my own calculation, so we might converge.

Now, on the earlier part of the paper, a few comments.

1) In Riemann or Lorentzian space, the tangent 4-vector of an affine parameterized curve is never zero, and remains constant on the curve.

2) What determines the metric ? See 'Einstein-Hilbert' action on Wiki and elsewhere. Also 'Geodesic deviation'.
This is a big topic, sorry I can't summarise in a few words.

3) Your treatment of SR and Minkowski space is fine. It just takes postulates like 'the proper time is the time shown on the clock travelling on the worldline' to make it the maths into physics.

All in all, a rewarding document, thanks. I'll be looking at it again very soon.
